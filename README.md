# Demographic-Data-Analyzer

### This project, "Demographic Data Analyzer", is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis in Python course. 
### The aim of this project is to analyze demographic data using Pandas library. The dataset used in this project is extracted from the 1994 Census database.

In this challenge, we are required to analyze the provided demographic dataset to answer the following questions:

1. How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?
2. What is the average age of men?
3. What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
4. What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
5. What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
6. What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
7. What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
8. What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
9. Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

## Project Structure
1. Demographic_Data_Analyzer.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
2. adjul.data.csv: Dataset extracted from the 1994 Census database.

Note: There are two files with the solution. 
Originally I solved the project on kaggle and the link is - https://www.kaggle.com/code/sujitchavhan/demographic-data-analyzer
For project purpose from FreeCodeCamp the solution is also in file name 'demographic_data_analyzer.py'
